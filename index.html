                    <button onclick="location.href='https://www.vortex.com/'">Find the Vortex website here !</button>
                    <p>In my search to find the worst website on the internet I stumbled upon what seems to be a weather forum website based in California. 
                        The Design was so bad that I felt deepeled moved to rid the worldwide web of such User Interface attrocities.

                    <h2> Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Layout:</b>The general lack of structure in this website severly decreases usability. We observe
                            a collection of hyperlinks with no apparent assocaition to one another. Furthermore, it is difficult to 
                            percieve which section of the website pertains to which specific topic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Efficiency:</b> As a knock on effect of the disorganization - the efficency of this website is affected. 
                            While navigating to each link is relativley simple, navigating back to the home page once leaving it is near impossible. 
                            Futhermore, each new page has more links attached leading the user down an iveitable rabbit hole.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Memorability</b> The design of Vortex is very umemborable - in fact after looking at it once I wanted to un-remember it forever.
                            The interface does not give a great impression at all and the design is highly illegible. There are also very few icons and all
                            links appear as hyperlinks.
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="textbox">
                        <b>Accessibility Issues:</b> In keeping with the theme - Vortex had a myriad of accessibility issues. Wave identified 
                        multiple instances of missing links where hyperlinked items were not actually linked to anything. In addition to this, 
                        it highlighted that the page had no page regions - only futher limiting accessibility. Furthermore, the page had no first level heading 
                        which disrupts the ability of assistive technologies to help readers.
